
Tryout for a basic server side interpreter to execute Powershell code from a html page.

I've introduced a few new html tags (a bit like php), in a html page, if you write:

<?pwsh
  <!-- write here some pwsh code -->
  Write-Host "some inline code, yey!"
pwsh>

This will be executed.
All html lines will be send to the client (that is the intention).
All powershell statements will be executed in the running Powershell "web instance" process.
